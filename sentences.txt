Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone   CHAPTER ONE  THE BOY WHO LIVED  Mr
 Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills
 He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache
 The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere
 They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters
 The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street
 The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him
 This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away
 they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that
 Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs
 Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair
  None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window
 He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive
 Dursley didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again
 What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light
 Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror
 It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign
 Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind
  But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else
 Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all
 Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something
 The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr
 Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills
 Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor
 If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning
 He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did
 they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead
 Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime
 He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more
 This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin
 He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking
 He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry
 Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry
 she always got so upset at any mention of her sister
 He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that
 Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak
 He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground
 He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was
 Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house
 He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife
 Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern
 Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea
 After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister
 and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today
 Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden
 It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something
  Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did
 Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind
 The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind
 In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all
  Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive
 He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots
 He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something
 For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him
 He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it
 The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop
 He clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness
 If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs
 Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement
 He didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it
 Shooting stars down in Kent -- I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle
' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name
 Everyone knows you're the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of
 I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs
 Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer
 The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they're -- dead
 They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry
 Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it
 You couldn't find two people who are less like us
 It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight
  If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it
 He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide
 In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets
 I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground
 Well -- give him here, Hagrid -- we'd better get this over with
 Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog
 For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle
 with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night
 On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer
 He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four
 He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone
 Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up
 Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls
 Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed
 The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too
  Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long
 He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having
 He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before
 And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday
  When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen
 The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents
 Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him
 Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes
  Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon
  Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother
 Is that all right''  Dudley thought for a moment
  Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap
 Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away
 Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned
  Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon
 Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat
 He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them
 Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid- jump
  While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia
  It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families
  Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time
  Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last
 It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls
 Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons
  Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils
 Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn't budge
 Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on
  Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake
 at least he got to visit the rest of the house
 Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's
 Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching
  The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling
  The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass
 Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor
 the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished
 The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor
 People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits
  Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch
 He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet
 Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food
 He couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died
 This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from
 His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions
 Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him
 A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus
 The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting
 Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private school, Smeltings
 Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school
  That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform
 Smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters
 They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking
 This was supposed to be good training for later life
 He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh
  There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast
 It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink
 The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water
 Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question
  They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat
  Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band
 No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him
 Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:  Mr
 a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H
  Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter
  Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard
 His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights
 Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge
 Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line
 For a moment it looked as though she might faint
 He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick
 Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole
 He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful
 we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley's second bedroom
 It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room
 He sat down on the bed and stared around him
 They were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched
  From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don't want him in there
 Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it
 Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the letter in the hall
 Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly
 They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall
 Surely that meant they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure they didn't fail
  The repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning
 He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights
 He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot
  On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry
  On Saturday, things began to get out of hand
 Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets
 The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one
 They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor
 I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave
 Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare ask where they were going
  They didn't stop to eat or drink all day
 He'd never had such a bad day in his life
  Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city
 Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets
  They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day
 They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table
 Potter? Only I got about an 'undred of these at the front desk
 Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew
 Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared
 Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea
 Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine
 One thing was certain, there was no television in there
 Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces
  Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas
 He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up
 Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail
 Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all
  As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them
  The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on
 He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger
 Dudley's snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight
 He hoped the roof wasn't going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did
 nine -- maybe he'd wake Dudley up, just to annoy him -- three
  The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door
   CHAPTER FOUR  THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS  BOOM
  There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room
  A giant of a man was standing in the doorway
  The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling
 He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame
  Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon
  Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on
 Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing
 Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage
 In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut
 He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren't bad
 Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard
 Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment
 We await your owl by no later than July 31
 Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone
  Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly
 It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years
 Anyway, this -- this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin' fer followers
 Didn't know who ter trust, didn't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches
 'Course, some stood up to him -- an' he killed 'em
 Didn't dare try takin' the school, not jus' then, anyway
 probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin' ter do with the Dark Side
 Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin' by then
 Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut
 Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage
 He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched
  Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them
 Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die
 Some say he's still out there, bidin' his time, like, but I don' believe it
 People who was on his side came back ter ours
 chased by Dudley's gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach
 dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he'd managed to make it grow back
 He's off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world
  Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard
 Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight
 When I open my eyes I'll be at home in my cupboard
  And there's Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking
 He went straight to the window and jerked it open
 The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn't wake up
 The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid's coat
 he won't pay for me to go and learn magic
 As a matter o' fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway
 Fetchin' you gettin' things from Gringotts -- knows he can trust me, see
 The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight
 And then yeh gotta find yer way -- Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see
 So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin' fer advice
 Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street
  Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station
 There was a train to London in five minutes' time
 Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent
 One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear  3
 One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar)  4
  Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily
 all Harry had to do was keep close behind him
 This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people
 yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn't help trusting him
 If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out, Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there
 In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it
 Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside
  For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby
 A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry
 The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in
 The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out
 Potter, just can't tell you, Diggle's the name, Dedalus Diggle
  A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously
  But the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself
 It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all
 At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble
 Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin' ter meet yeh -- mind you, he's usually tremblin'
 Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can
 Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall
  The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop
 Several boys of about Harry's age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it
  They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops
 He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet
 Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals
 They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches
 It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor
 Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them
 They climbed in -- Hagrid with some difficulty -- and were off
  At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages
 Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible
 The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn't steering
  Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open
 A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped
 The Dursleys couldn't have known about this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking
  Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag
 Right, that should be enough fer a couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest safe for yeh
  They were going even deeper now and gathering speed
 The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners
 He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away
 Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor
 Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat
 Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask
  One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts
 Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money
  Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve
 I don't see why first years can't have their own
 I think I'll bully father into getting me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow
 He was liking the boy less and less every second
 He didn't feel much like going into the matter with this boy
 Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine
 I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families
 Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote
 He told Hagrid about the pate boy in Madam Malkin's
 You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh
 books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk
 books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all
 Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these
 jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls
 bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling
 All the kids want owls, they're dead useful, carry yer mail an' everythin'
 He couldn't stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell
 Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand
 this was what Harry had been really looking forward to
 Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B
 A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window
  A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside
 It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait
 Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library
 The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic
 It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand
 Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow
 Well, I say your father favored it -- it's really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course
 Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose
 Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry's forehead with a long, white finger
 well, if I'd known what that wand was going out into the world to do
 Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke
 We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons
 And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard's wand
 Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once
 Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become
 I think we must expect great things from you, Mr
 After all, He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things -- terrible, yes, but great
 He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr
 Harry didn't speak at all as they walked down the road
 Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder
  He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them
 How can they expect great things? I'm famous and I can't even remember what I'm famous for
 I don't know what happened when Vol-, sorry -- I mean, the night my parents died
 Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile
 Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you'll be just fine
 But yeh'll have a great time at Hogwarts -- I did -- still do, 'smatter of fact
 Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she'll know where to find me
 Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight
 Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty
 Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while
  Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company
 He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic
 He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket
 We're going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn't bother
 Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him
  He stopped a passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and three-quarters
 In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters
 The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair
 They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying
 He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose
 Don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it, that's very important
 Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous
  He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier
 People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten
 A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people
 Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat
  A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd
 He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door
 Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train's open door
 He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform
 As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school
  Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner
  The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in
 He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn't looked
 Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose
  Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar
 You could say I've got a lot to live up to
 Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch
 I've got Bill's old robes, Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat
 He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window
  Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl
 There's loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough
 Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep
 They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past
 What she did have were Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs
  Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it
 I've got about five hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy
 He wore half- moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache
  Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore's face had disappeared
 No, I've got Morgana again and I've got about six of her
 Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin
  The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder
 Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills
 It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end
 Anyway  He had just raised his 'wand when the compartment door slid open again
 The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him
 She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth
 I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn't be too bad
 You two had better change, you know, I expect we'll be there soon
 I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin
 'Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who's behind it
 He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You- Know-Who was mentioned
 He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he'd shown back in Diagon Alley
 Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards
 My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford
 You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort
  Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks
 You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you
 He says Malfoy's father didn't need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side
 He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky
  He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes
 Ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them
 Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately
 They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor
 People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform
 It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there
 Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice
 Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione
 Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead
 It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood
  They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, Oak front door
   CHAPTER SEVEN  THE SORTING HAT  The door swung open at once
 She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross
 The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it
  They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor
 They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously
 Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards
 I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours
 I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting
 Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking
 He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too
 Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom
 About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall
 One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall
  Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place
 These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets
 At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting
 The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight
 Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver
 On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat
 It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again
 Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment
  Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment
 Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her
 several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them
 He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school
  A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous
 The hat took a long time to decide with Neville
 Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat
 There's talent, A my goodness, yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting
 He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table
 At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up
 And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore
 Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train
 Dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts
 Harry spotted Professor Quirtell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron
 He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban
  And now there were only three people left to be sorted
 Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away
 The dishes in front of him were now piled with food
 Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick
 Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat
 I don't think I've in troduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service
 Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly
 Mom didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married
 But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road
 They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy
 Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad
  Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at  the High Table again
 He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want to -- everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job
  At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again
 And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well
 Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors
 Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch
 I do think he might have told us prefects, at least
 Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed
 At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march
 Harry's legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food
  Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville's head
 They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed
  Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another
 Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed
  Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream
 Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin
   CHAPTER EIGHT  THE POTIONS MASTER  There, look
 Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes
  There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones
 some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump
 Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning
 Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch's
 The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs
  And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves
 Harry had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross
 Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class
 By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match
  Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else
 There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start
  Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron
 They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once
 They say he always favors them -- we'll be able to see if it's true
  At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him
 By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong
  Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons
 Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class
 His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth
 They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels
 He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter
 As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite
 Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils
 Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville
 Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest
 A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door
  When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks
 Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked
 I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest
 Fang rested his head on Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes
 Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students
  Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken
 The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day
 The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day
 To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy
 Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer
 Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move
  Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was
 This was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book -- not that she hadn't tried
  A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother
 Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red -- oh
  The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground
 She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk
 It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles
  Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did
 Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all
 Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry
 Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years
  Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his
  No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter
 He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared
  He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair
 Malfoy only just got out of the way in time
 Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady
 He was going to be expelled, he just knew it
 He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice
 Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him
 She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her
 He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper
 Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing
 Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys
 Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year
 Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape in the face for weeks
 Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall
 He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon
 You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us
 The most you and Malfoy'll be able to do is send sparks at each other
 Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage
 Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today
 A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows
 It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown
 He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole
 She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose
 The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower
 He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer
 The password's 'Pig snout' but it won't help you now, the Fat Lady's gone off somewhere
  They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows
 At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs
 They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room
 The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them
 Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness
 They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room
 Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once
  Then a noise in the next room made them jump
 Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak -and it wasn't Malfoy
 Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible
 they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch's voice
 Neville's robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room
  The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle
 He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight
  They weren't in a room, as he had supposed
 three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs
  Harry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, he'd take Filch
 They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor
 They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs
  It was a while before any of them said anything
 We could all have been killed -- or worse, expelled
  But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed
  Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor
 All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again
 Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session
  Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy's obvious rage and confusion
 Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand
  Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day
  Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful
 At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end
 The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch
 fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm
 Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops
 I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring
 Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box
  At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry's face
 We've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that
 Now, the last member of the team is the  Seeker
 And you don't have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers unless they crack my head open
 Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut
 It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings
 It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see
  Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted
 After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on
 The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had
 His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics
  On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors
 Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye)
 It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this
 She hadn't spoken to either of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived
  Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck
 Harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she was in tears
 The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet
 It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence
 As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm
 They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them
  Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape
  And then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet
 Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them
 They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight
 It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet
 It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long
  The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside
 It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room
 With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it
  Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint
 The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went
 It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise
 It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went
  The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk
 It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape
  Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life
 Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done
 It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue
  A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up
 Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's mind
 Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air
  Then a small voice came out of the shadows
 Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club
 It was about to finish me off when they arrived
 It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets
 If you're not hurt at all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor tower
 It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else
  They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady
 Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up
 Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them
  But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend
   CHAPTER ELEVEN  QUIDDITCH  As they entered November, the weather turned very cold
 The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel
 On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin
 If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship
  It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend
 She had also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read
 They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard
 Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view
  The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening
 Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window
 Hermione was checking Harry and Ron's Charms homework for them
 He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow
  He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked
  Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try
 He pushed the door ajar and peered inside -- and a horrible scene met his eyes
 In an hour's time he'd be walking onto the field
  By eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch
  Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row
 Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors
 She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand
 Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year
 Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him
  Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle
  Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air
 Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch
 In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold
 But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again
 For a split second, he thought he was going to fall
 He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees
 It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off
 But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off
 No one seemed to have noticed that Harry's broom was behaving strangely
 It was carrying- him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went
 His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on
 Harry's broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it
 He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand
 Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them
 He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath
 His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer
 They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell
 Marcus  Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing
 she didn't even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front
 Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well- chosen words
 Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape's robes
  It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire
 A sudden yelp told her she had done her job
 Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom
 Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes
 He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Hermione
 He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you
 We think he was trying to steal whatever it's guarding
  The afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape
   CHAPTER TWELVE  THE MIRROR OF ERISED  Christmas was coming
 One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow
  No one could wait for the holidays to start
 Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them
 Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match
 So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family
  It was true that Harry wasn't going back to Privet Drive for Christmas
 this would probably be the best Christmas he'd ever had
 He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time
 he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry
 And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library
 He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in there
  Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him
 He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel
 What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks
  Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads
 Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted
  Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn't trust him at all
 It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid
 Harry blew it -- it sounded a bit like an owl
  We received your message and enclose your Christmas present
  His next present also contained candy -- a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione
  Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds
 It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material
 Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible
 He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely
 He didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else yet
 But we're not stupid -- we know we're called Gred and Forge
  Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving
  Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner
 Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice
  Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds
 He suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much
 Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day
 Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it
 He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air
 He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself
 Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows
 The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak
 Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence
 He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know
  Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought
 He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked
 Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books
  The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library
 Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn't understand
 One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood
 Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book
 He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once
  He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor
 Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all
 They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away
 It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in
 There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi
  He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming
 Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror
 Harry looked over his shoulder -- but still, no one was there
 A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving
 He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him
 Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying
 The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her
 It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did
 He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness
 He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed
 He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight
 With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night
 They tried retracing Harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour
 just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor
 Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror
 His mother and father beamed at the sight of him
  Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry
  That third night he found his way more quickly than before
 Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror
 There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family
 Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore
 Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him
 You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you
 However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth
 If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared
 It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that
 But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question
 Harry wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn't
  Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things
 Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks
 Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again
 Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits
 The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's side
 He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower
  Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse
 Neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling
 He said he'd been looking for someone to practice that on
 He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry
 She hadn't looked so excited since they'd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework
  At last she found what she was looking for
 It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal
 it'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win
 At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own
 Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry
 Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse
 Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much
  Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe
 There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching
 Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him
 Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet
 Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground
 Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help
 it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly
  Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground
 Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed
  A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle
 Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest
 Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run
  The trees were so thick he couldn't see where Snape had gone
 He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices
 He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree
 Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn't alone
 Harry couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever
 d-don't know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus
 It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified
 Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe
  Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer's Stone
 She had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes
 Harry and Ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same
 It was the first really fine day they'd had in months
 The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming
 He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat
 You should see the burns Charlie's got off wild ones in Romania
 The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you
 Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who've spotted them, to make them forget
 Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate
 Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused
 Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn' tell yeh if I could
 Hagrid's beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling
 He probably knew everything -- except, it seemed, Quirrell's spell and how to get past Fluffy
 In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg
 Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest
 An' see here -- how ter recognize diff'rent eggs -- what I got there's a Norwegian Ridgeback
 Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too
  Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid
  Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut
  Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen
 How much had he heard? Harry didn't like the look on Malfoy's face at all
  They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath
  All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open
 He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon's head
 They spent most of their free time in Hagrid's darkened hut, trying to reason with him
 It had grown three times in length in just a week
 Hagrid hadn't been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy
 There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor
 The clock on the wall had just  chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open
 Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry's invisibility cloak
 When it bit me he told me off for frightening it
 And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby
 Trouble is, they mustn't be seen carrying an illegal dragon
  Love,  Charlie  They looked at one another
 By the next morning, Ron's bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size
 On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat
 Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep
 And we have got the invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn't know about that
 Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come quickly enough
 Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate
 UP another staircase, then another -- even one of Harry's shortcuts didn't make the work much easier
  Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate
  Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear
  Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate
 About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness
 They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them
 As they stepped into the corridor, Filch's face loomed suddenly out of the darkness
   CHAPTER FIFTEEN  THE FORIBIDDEN FOREST  Things couldn't have been worse
 He couldn't see how they were going to get out of trouble this time
 Add Norbert and the invisibility cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already
  Had Harry thought that things couldn't have been worse? He was wrong
 She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them
 She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue
 Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this
 All three of you will receive detentions -- yes, you too, Mr
 In one night, they'd ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup
 Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach
 How could they ever make up for this?  Harry didn't sleep all night
 He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours
 Harry couldn't think of anything to say to comfort him
 Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn't trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him
 Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence
  Harry was almost glad that the exams weren't far away
 All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery
  Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban
 He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry
 He waited until Quirrell's footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom
 It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end
 Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he'd promised himself about not meddling
  Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy
 If we try anything ourselves we'll be thrown out for sure
 And don't forget, we're not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy
  The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table
 They were all the same:  Your detention will take place at eleven o'clock tonight
 Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too
 hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me
 It's just a pity they let the old punishments die out
 It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted
  The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness
 Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid's hut
 if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn't be so bad
 He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder
 If yeh think yer father'd rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an' pack
 He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze
 A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest
 There's a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat
 We might have ter put it out of its misery
 Right, now, we're gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent directions
 There's blood all over the place, it must've bin staggerin' around since last night at least
  They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground
 There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path
 He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire
 Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground
 Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away
 This is Harry Potter an' Hermione Granger, by the way
 He flung back his head and stared at the sky
 Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they're good enough about turnin' up if ever I want a word
 He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them
 They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid's arm
 Harry's seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig
 What was going on? Where were the others?  At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid's return
 Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke
 Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak
  It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead
  Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood
 Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast
 It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry -- he couldn't move for fear
  Then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head
 He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure
  The pain in Harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees
 A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane
 He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry's forehead
 The forest is not safe at this time -- especially for you
  There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing
 Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty
  Harry didn't have a clue what was going on
 They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped
 Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die
  Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return
 He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake
 He paced up and down in front of the fire
 and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich
 he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen
  When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them
 There was a note pinned to it:  Just in case
  It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers
 They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell
 Anyway, we've never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy
 He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not going to try it again in a hurry
 And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down
 Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters
 Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy
  Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house
 his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl
 Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn' he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up
 he asked what I did, an' I told him I was gamekeeper here
 He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after
 an' I said what I'd always really wanted was a dragon
 I can' remember too well, 'cause he kept buyin' me drinks
 So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy
 Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn't stop him
 The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn't pick them up
 I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine
 He's found out everything he needs, and now he's got Dumbledore out of the way
 They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back
  Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others
 none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all
 This was the first night he hadn't been upset by it
 Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do
  Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed
 He pocketed it to use on Fluffy -- he didn't feel much like singing
 They couldn't afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep
 Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror
  But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very good omen
 At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs
 Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn't do anything
  They didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor
 Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip
 He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs
  As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears
 All three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see them
 It wasn't really a tune, but from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop
 They could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads
 He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open
 Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep
  Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor
  He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips
 Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and -- FLUMP
 With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft
 He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom
 It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant
 There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped
 As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing
  Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her
 Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free
 The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts
 If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon -- Norbert had been bad enough
 A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead
 It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room
 On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door
 He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened
  Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century
 He had a knack for spotting things other people didn't
  They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand
 He rammed it into the lock and turned -- it worked
  The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all
 But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight
 Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces
 Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly -- the towering white chessmen had no faces
 The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron
 I suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces
 Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall
 Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger
 He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones
  The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet
 The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear
  A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses
 At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward
 A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here forever
 one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple
 Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them
 I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I'm no match for him, really
 She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered
  Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle
  It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body
  There was already someone there -- but it wasn't Snape
   CHAPTER SEVENTEEN  THE MAN WITH TWO FACES  It was Quirrell
 Another few seconds and I'd have got you off that broom
 I'd have managed it before then if Snape hadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you
 All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular
 and what a waste of time, when after all that, I'm going to kill you tonight
 Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry
  It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell
 I'll be far away by the time he gets back
 Tried to frighten me - as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side
 He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror
 He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn't you know? They loathed each other
 A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil
 There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it
 Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times
 When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased
 decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me
 I must look and lie about what I see, that's all
 Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell's turban
 He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again
  He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first
 It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone
 As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer's Stone against his leg
 Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban
  Harry would have screamed, but he couldn't make a sound
 It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake
  Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn't move
 I have form only when I can share another's body
 but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds
 you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest
  Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him
 Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain
 his head felt as though it was about to split in two
 he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him
 The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy
 The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him
 Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it
 Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried
 Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you
 I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you
 For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had
 After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure
 You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing
 Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself
 He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share
 he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies
 Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me
 If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love
 He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark
 It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good
 your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here
 And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive
 Then he could go back to hating your father's memory in peace
 It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something
 I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance
 I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know
 I don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked
 It's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could
  After a good night's sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal
 As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed
 He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears
 Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it's gone, he can't use it
 Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it
 'Course, he shoulda sacked me instead -- anyway, got yeh this
 Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father
  Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night
 A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table
  When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once
 What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were
 you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts
 Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two
 Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table
for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points
 for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points
 Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves -- they were a hundred points up
 The room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points
 They had tied for the house cup -- if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point
 He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before
 In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold
 the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place
 Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile
 He caught Harry's eye and Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot
  Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did
 To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks
 Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years
 Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one
 It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn't have everything in life
 Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake
 talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier
 eating Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns
 pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats
 pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King's Cross Station
  It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform
  He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together
 Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry
  Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione
 I'm going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer
